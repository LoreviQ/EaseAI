    This node will be responsible for:
    - Quality assurance of generated slides, notes, and tutorials
    - Consistency checking across all content pieces

    4. Handle user feedback and content iterations
    5. Manage final approval and project completion workflow
    6. Update project phase to COMPLETE when satisfied
