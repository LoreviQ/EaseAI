def content_node(state: OverallState, session: Session) -> OverallState:
    """
    TODO: Generate presentation content (slides, speaker notes, delivery tutorial).

    This node will be responsible for:
    - Creating slide content based on the presentation plan
    - Generating detailed speaker notes for each slide
    - Producing delivery tutorials and practice exercises
    - Coordinating parallel content generation tasks

    Future implementation will:
    1. Parse the finalized presentation plan from the conversation phase
    2. Generate slides using the Slides domain model
    3. Create speaker notes using the SpeakerNotes domain model
    4. Produce delivery tutorials using the DeliveryTutorial domain model
    5. Save all content to the database using respective adapters

    Args:
        state: Current workflow state with presentation plan
        session: Database session for content persistence

    Returns:
        Updated state with generated content references
